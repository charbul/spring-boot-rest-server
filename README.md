##Start the application
Tips to search for a file (Ctrl + Shift + N): Type Application!
When we open RestutorialApplication, we should see a green triangle on the left of the main Method there
we can click on it to start the application.
The application does nothing for now. We should see "Started RestutorialApplication in..."
This shows us that the application does nothing yet but has started successfully.

Congratulations. We have created an application with one step which is the base for very easy development.
